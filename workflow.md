Key Features
## Failure Resilience
If your platform experiences a temporary outage, your workflow can pick up right where it left off, ensuring stability even in unstable environments.
## Long-Running Executions
Run long-running REST endpoints, such as complex AI models or video processing tools, even on serverless platforms with strict time limits.
## Events with Wait/Notify Mechanism
Create workflows that wait for external events before proceeding. Ideal for user confirmations and asynchronous notifications.
## Scheduled Jobs
Run jobs at regular intervals with support for cron expressions. Perfect for recurring tasks like reminders, reports, or newsletters.
## Parallel Runs
Start independent tasks in parallel and wait for them to finish simultaneously, reducing latency.
## Long Delays
Need your code to “sleep” for days, weeks, or even months? Supports long delays beyond serverless time limits.
## Delivery Guarantees
Ensures at-least-once delivery. Failed requests are logged in a Dead Letter Queue to prevent data loss.
## Flow Control
Prevent overwhelming your app or external services by configuring rate per second or parallelism limits.
## Observability
Monitor workflow steps with insights. Filter events to track successes, failures, retries, and stalls.

Example Use Cases
Here are some example real world use-cases for Upstash Workflow:
## Agents
Use LLM Agents equipped with custom tools to achieve tasks
## AI Data Processing
Download a large dataset without timeouts, process the data in chunks and generate a report.
## Waiting For Events
Control workflow execution with events, log event data and send emails
## Authorization Webhook
Start a workflow from a webhook. Handle user creation, trial management, email reminders and notifications.
## Customer Onboarding
Register a new user, send welcome emails, and periodically check and respond to the user’s activity state with emails.
## E-Commerce Order Fulfillment
Receive an order request, verify the stock, process the payment, and handle order dispatch and customer notifications.
## Image Processing
Manage uploading images to the data store. Apply filters and resize the images to different resolutions in parallel.
## Retry Payments
Retry payments with a day of delay, send emails, and suspend account if payment fails after the retries.

How it works
Upstash Workflow builds on the principle of steps. Instead of defining a single, complex piece of business logic, workflows contain multiple individual steps. Each of the steps are executed by a separate request to your application, by preserving the output of previous steps. In case of an error, a failed step is retried individually without needing to re-run any previous steps. Instead of the entire business logic, _each step_ can take up your serverless function execution duration, and many more benefits.
