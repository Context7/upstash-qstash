Send your first message

Public API
Make sure you have a publicly available HTTP API that you want to send your messages to. If you don’t, you can use something like requestcatcher.com, webhook.site or webhook-test.com to try it out. For example, you can use this URL to test your messages: https://firstqstashmessage.requestcatcher.com

A message can be any shape or form: json, xml, binary, anything, that can be transmitted in the http request body. We do not impose any restrictions other than a size limit of 1 MB (which can be customized at your request). In addition to the request body itself, you can also send HTTP headers.
