Workflow changelogs are here
​
July 2025
  * **TypeScript SDK (`qstash-js`):**
    * Added `retryDelay` option to dynamicaly program the retry duration of a failed message. The new parameter is available in publish/batch/enqueue/schedules. See here
    * Full changelog, including all fixes, is available here.


​
June 2025
  * No new features for QStash this month. We are mostly focused on stability and performance.


​
May 2025
  * **TypeScript SDK (`qstash-js`):**
    * Added `flow control period` and deprecated `ratePerSecond`. See here.
    * Added `IN_PROGRESS` state filter. See here.
    * Full changelog, including all fixes, is available here.
  * **Python SDK (`qstash-py`):**
    * Added `IN_PROGRESS` state filter. See here.
    * Added various missing features: Callback Headers, Schedule with Queue, Overwrite Schedule ID, Flow Control Period. See here.
    * Full changelog, including all fixes, is available here.
  * **Console:**
    * Improved logs tab behavior to prevent collapsing or unnecessary refreshes, increasing usability.
  * **QStash Server:**
    * Added support for filtering messages by `FlowControlKey` (Console and SDK support in progress).
    * Applied performance improvements for bulk cancel operations.
    * Applied performance improvements for bulk publish operations.
    * Fixed an issue where scheduled publishes with queues would reset queue parallelism to 1.
    * Added support for updating existing queue parallelisms even when the max queue limit is reached.
    * Applied several additional performance optimizations.


​
April 2025
  * **QStash Server:**
    * Added support for `flow-control period`, allowing users to define a period for a given rate—up to 1 week.  
Previously, the period was fixed at 1 second.  
For example, `rate: 3 period: 1d` means publishes will be throttled to 3 per day.
    * Applied several performance optimizations.
  * **Console:**
    * Added `IN_PROGRESS` as a filter option when grouping by message ID, making it easier to query in-flight messages.  
See here for an explanation of message states.


​
March 2025
  * **TypeScript SDK (`qstash-js`):**
    * Renamed `events` to `logs` for clarity when referring to QStash features. `client.events()` is now deprecated, and `client.logs()` has been introduced. See details here.
    * For all fixes, see the full changelog here.
  * **QStash Server:**
    * Fixed an issue where messages with delayed callbacks were silently failing. Now, such messages are explicitly rejected during insertion.


​

  * **Python SDK (`qstash-py`):**
    * Flow Control Parallelism and Rate. See here
    * Addressed a few minor bugs. See the full changelog here
  * **QStash Server:**
    * Introduced RateLimit and Parallelism controls to manage the rate and concurrency of message processing. Learn more here.
    * Improved connection timeout detection mechanism to enhance scalability.
    * Added several new features to better support webhook use cases: 
      * Support for saving headers in a URL group. See here.
      * Ability to pass configuration parameters via query strings instead of headers. See here.
      * Introduced a new `Upstash-Header-Forward` header to forward all headers from the incoming request. See here.


​
January 2025
  * **Python SDK (`qstash-py`):**
    * Addressed a few minor bugs. See the full changelog here.
  * **Local Development Server:**
    * The local development server is now publicly available. This server allows you to test your Qstash setup locally. Learn more about the local development server here.
  * **Console:**
    * Separated the Workflow and QStash consoles for an improved user experience.
    * Separated their DLQ messages as well.
  * **QStash Server:**
    * The core team focused on RateLimit and Parallelism features. These features are ready on the server and will be announced next month after the documentation and SDKs are completed.


​
December 2024
  * **TypeScript SDK (`qstash-js`):**
    * Added global headers to the client, which are automatically included in every publish request.
    * Resolved issues related to the Anthropics and Resend integrations.
    * Full changelog, including all fixes, is available here.
  * **Python SDK (`qstash-py`):**
    * Introduced support for custom `schedule_id` values.
    * Enabled passing headers to callbacks using the `Upstash-Callback-Forward-...` prefix.
    * Full changelog, including all fixes, is available here.
  * **Qstash Server:**
    * Finalized the local development server, now almost ready for public release.
    * Improved error reporting by including the field name in cases of invalid input.
    * Increased the maximum response body size for batch use cases to 100 MB per REST call.
    * Extended event retention to up to 14 days, instead of limiting to the most recent 10,000 events. Learn more on the Pricing page.


​
November 2024
  * **TypeScript SDK (qstash-js):**
    * Added support for the Anthropics provider and refactored the `api` field of `publishJSON`. See the documentation here.
    * Full changelog, including fixes, is available here.
  * **Qstash Server:**
    * Fixed a bug in schedule reporting. The Upstash-Caller-IP header now correctly reports the user’s IP address instead of an internal IP for schedules.
    * Validated the scheduleId parameter. The scheduleId must now be alphanumeric or include hyphens, underscores, or periods.
    * Added filtering support to bulk message cancellation. Users can now delete messages matching specific filters. See Rest API here.
    * Resolved a bug that caused the DLQ Console to become unusable when data was too large.
    * Fixed an issue with queues that caused them to stop during temporary network communication problems with the storage layer.


​
October 2024
  * **TypeScript SDK (qstash-js):**
    * Fixed a bug on qstash-js where we skipped using the next signing key when the current signing key fails to verify the `upstash-signature`. Released with qstash-js v2.7.14.
    * Added resend API. See here. Released with qstash-js v2.7.14.
    * Added `schedule to queues` feature to the qstash-js. See here. Released with qstash-js v2.7.14.
  * **Console:**
    * Optimized the console by trimming event bodies, reducing resource usage and enabling efficient querying of events with large payloads.
  * **Qstash Server:**
    * Began development on a new architecture to deliver faster event processing on the server.
    * Added more fields to events in the REST API, including `Timeout`, `Method`, `Callback`, `CallbackHeaders`, `FailureCallback`, `FailureCallbackHeaders`, and `MaxRetries`.
    * Enhanced retry backoff logic by supporting additional headers for retry timing. Along with `Retry-After`, Qstash now recognizes `X-RateLimit-Reset`, `X-RateLimit-Reset-Requests`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset-Tokens` as backoff time indicators. See here for more details.


​
September 2024
  * Improved performance, resulting in reduced latency for average publish times.
  * Set the `nbf` (not before) claim on Signing Keys to 0. This claim specifies the time before which the JWT must not be processed. Previously, this was incorrectly used, causing validation issues when there were minor clock discrepancies between systems.
  * Fixed queue name validation. Queue names must now be alphanumeric or include hyphens, underscores, or periods, consistent with other API resources.
  * Resolved bugs related to overwriting a schedule.


​
August 2024
  * Released Upstash Workflow.
  * Fixed a bug where paused schedules were mistakenly resumed after a process restart (typically occurring during new version releases).

  * Addded order query parameter to /v2/events and /v2/dlq endpoints.
