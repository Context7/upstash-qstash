serve(async (req: Request) => {
  const r = new Receiver({
    currentSigningKey: Deno.env.get("QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY")!,
    nextSigningKey: Deno.env.get("QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY")!,
  });

  const isValid = await r
    .verify({
      signature: req.headers.get("Upstash-Signature")!,
      body: await req.text(),
    })
    .catch((err: Error) => {
      console.error(err);
      return false;
    });

  if (!isValid) {
    return new Response("Invalid signature", { status: 401 });
