The resumableQuery method allows you to perform queries that can be resumed to fetch additional results. This is particularly useful for large result sets or when implementing pagination.
The dimension of the query vector must match the dimension of your index.
The score returned from query requests is a normalized value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates the highest similarity and 0 the lowest regardless of the similarity function used.

Arguments
​
Payload
ResumableQueryPayload
required
Hide child attributes
​
vector | sparseVector | data
number[] | SparseVector | string
required
There are two ways to use the resumableQuery method. You can either create the vectors on your own and pass directly the `vector` or `sparseVector` field, depending on your index type. Or you can pass the `data` field and create the embeddings using Upstash Embedding.
The query data/vector that you want to search for in the index.
​
topK
number
required
The initial number of vectors to retrieve in the query result. The response will be sorted based on the distance metric score.
​
includeMetadata
boolean
Whether to include the metadata of the vectors in the response. Setting this `true` would be the best practice, since it will make it easier to identify the vectors.
​
includeVectors
boolean
Whether to include the vector values in the response.
​
includeData
boolean
Whether to include the data field in the response.
​
filter
string
The metadata filtering of the vector. This is used to query your data based on the filters and narrow down the query results.If you want to learn more about filtering check: Metadata Filtering
​
weightingStrategy
WeightingStrategy
For sparse vectors, what kind of weighting strategy should be used while querying the matching non-zero dimension values of the query vector with the documents. If not provided, no weighting will be used.
​
fusionAlgorithm
FusionAlgorithm
Fusion algorithm to use while fusing scores from dense and sparse components of a hybrid index. If not provided, defaults to `RRF`.
​
queryMode
QueryMode
Query mode for hybrid indexes with Upstash-hosted embedding models. Specifies whether to run the query in only the dense index, only the sparse index, or in both. If not provided, defaults to `HYBRID`.
​
maxIdle
number
Maximum idle time for the resumable query in seconds.
## 
​
Response
​
ResumableQueryResponse
Object
required
Hide child attributes
​
result
QueryResult[]
required
The initial query results.
​
fetchNext
(additionalK: number) => Promise<Vector[]>
required
A function to fetch the next batch of results.
​
stop
() => Promise<string>
required
A function to stop the resumable query and release resources.
​
QueryResult
Object
required
Hide child attributes
​
id
string | number
required
The ID of the resulting vector.
​
score
number
required
The score of the vector data, calculated based on the distance metric of your index.
​
vector
number[]
The resulting vector (if `includeVectors` is set to true)
​
sparseVector
SparseVector
The resulting sparseVector (if `includeVectors` is set to true)
​
metadata
Record<string, unknown>
The metadata of the vector (if `includeMetadata` is set to true)
​
data
string
The data of the vector (if `includeData` is set to true)
